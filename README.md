# Portfolio-Project

## What I Did

- For this project, I wanted to create a portfolio website to show case my skills a developer for my potential employers. 
- I created a website showing some of my work, and how to contact me.

## Instructions for Use:

- The website is very straight forward. There are a few different clickable links at the top right hand side of the website to help the user navigate.
- In the work section, there are clickable images going to some projects of mine. At this time, they are place holder projects.
